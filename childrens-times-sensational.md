# A fire-resistant balloon to represent baptism

One example of underlying science: [Steve Spanglers Science: Fireproof Balloon](http://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/fire-water-balloon/?utm_source=bm23&utm_medium=email&utm_term=Image+-+Experiment+of+the+Week&utm_content=Experiment+of+the+Week+-+Fire-resistant+Balloon&utm_campaign=05/04/2016&_bta_tid=3.AIqa.CynWSQ.DjGD.Ae8MrQ..AnPVhg.b..l.CvaO.n...sFEOyQ)

## Dialogue

Good morning. Have you ever wondered about this baptism thing, how possibly a minister putting a little bit of water on a baby's head can really make any difference? I mean who thought that one up?

As you know, some churches go for immersion, where your whole body goes underwater, even for babies. If a bit of water is good, wouldn't a whole lot be better?

I would like to show how you a little bit of water can make quite a difference.

So we will blow up this balloon. And we will say that it's a life.

And over here we have a candle lit. And I probably don't need to tell you that balloons and flames don't mix all that well, and I almost need to apologize for using flames when we are so conscious of forest fires in this country.

         So what happens when a balloon makes contact with a flame?  Anyone want to try? Are you ready for this? Not nice. Life does seem to blow up in your face sometimes doesn�t it?
        All of us have been aware of flames in our lives. We�ve all had scares. Life can be hard. We are often conscious of ways that we can be hurt, and the risks that must be avoided.
        So what possible difference can a bit of water or a baptism make?  
        Why do we do it? Is it, as they used to say, fire insurance? Few of us believe in hell anymore, which was more Dante than the Bible anyway, at least apart from some of life�s experiences like Fort McMurray was, so it�s got to be more than that.
        Well let�s put a little bit of water in this balloon, this life, and see if it makes a difference. Baptise it? We�ll blow it up, and bring it close to the flame, and see if a bit of water will make any difference. So is the water a help or does it make it riskier? Do I dare? How close can we get it? It can even touch the flame. You can see the difference a little water can make.  
        Now it does leave a pretty black spot of soot. My life is covered with black spots from getting close to a lot of flames.
         We�re not wanting to suggest that baptism is some magic protective skin. It�s not. It�s just a symbol. But I shouldn�t say �just a symbol. Symbols are powerful.
         Martin Luther said during some very tough times �I am baptized. He wasn�t saying life was easy. His life was on the line, big flames even. 
          He was saying that his God connection gave him courage and chutzpah, and energy and focus. And his baptism was a symbol of that.
          So too a little water on a child�s head in itself isn�t much. But these children may have times in their lives when they are faced with some really hot flames & be able to say: I�m baptized. God is with me. I can do it. 
May �God�� go with you
       
Easter / Pentecost  The egg, bottle & candles
       We want to celebrate Affirming, inclusivity, welcoming. Ever heard those words before? Basically  to say everybody matters  which this season is about
Well I�ve brought a bottle which we could say represents our gathering or even wholeness. And a hardboiled, shelled, egg, a symbol of new life. And we want Miss Susie here to belong and to feel she belongs, but at the moment she�s an outsider, outside the bottle, and do you see an easy way for her to get inside. She is at least soft; hardshelled folks may not be that interested anyway. The bottle walls are foreboding and the neck is just a bit narrow; should I push? -Being made into an egg salad is hardly a sign of welcome.
       And well, it�s not that inviting, so maybe she isn�t that interested.
       The issue is not to get Miss Susie to go on a diet so she can make the narrow way. The narrow way Jesus spoke about was not about restrictions or hardships, about cramping your style, but of a focus on justice and openness.
       So, it�s not about finding ways Miss Susie ought to change to fit, but of finding ways our gathering can change -to be more accommodating.
       Do you remember the symbols of Pentecost? They were wind and fire. That gathering got a little more fire in their belly, well the story says on their heads. And with the fire there was light, and the wind may actually have been voice. 
       So to do this, to invite all into wholeness, begins with turning the bottle upside down, because to be open to our community and all the isms in it, we need to move from one definition of the way it has to be, and to a point, turn ourselves upside down. Didn�t Jesus turn the world upside down?  It�s not Susie who has to change, but the community.
       How will we get Susie here to rise, to move upward into this gathering? The way is a little narrow; the entrance is a little tight �for both Susie and the gathering. 
            Well none of us can get into wholeness on our own; we thrive only in communities. We need the diverse light of the friends and allies to point us the way. 
       Well I just happened to bring some lights with me, some birthday candles. We will stick these 3 small birthday candles of different rainbow colours into one end of this embryo.  We will light the candles, and as when people around us let their lights shine, and that�s not lights all the same but different colours and perspectives, then things can happen. It helps to have some diverse people around us who are at least a little bit on fire. 
       We will put the candles into the entrance (and the egg seals the entrance. The gathering does have some responsibility for sealing and bonding.) Well, the ushers found a place in the gathering for one seen as outside. Do not all folks around us need to let their lights shine in order to be whole? And only when the gathering is prepared to sacrifice some of its oxygen, can new life happen.  
        So now what? Yes, that�s right. How do we get her out? For this is all very wonderful, but you know, wholeness is not just for me; it�s not just personal;  it�s not even just us. This is actually a rather enclosed space. Doesn�t it look a touch confining? Do you want to spend the rest of your life in a milk bottle? Like why did you come to church, or this event, but to get out again?
Yes to be whole one needs a diverse intimate community, but one also needs to get out into the world. To get this lass out into the world we need God�s creative Pentecostal breath. So basically we blow as hard as we can up into the bottle and that added air will push our wee lass back out into the world to serve in one piece no less. Well isn�t that Affirming?  -fired up to be community and with God�s breath and spirit out into the world.	Godspeed.    	John 10: go in and out to find pasture   https://youtu.be/Of-p9pUy6wg
